- Hi my name is Nathan, I'm glad you are interested in my profile, read a little bit about me: 
My first contact with code was in 2007, since then I developed such a passion for web and mobile development. I'm very focused on my constant personal evolution and professional career, I'm very happy to do what I love since I was a kid. I practice every day and I trust in my abilities to create solutions and solve problems. I have knowledge and some work in companies with Mobile development using React Native. At my current company, I'm working with Laravel, creating internal and external systems.
